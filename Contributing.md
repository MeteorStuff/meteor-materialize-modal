### Contributing to Materialize Modal

Before submitting an issue please make sure that the issue is not a problem in [materializecss](http://materializecss.com).  All the CSS except for the full screen modal is pulled from the 
[materializecss](http://materializecss.com) framework and we try not to fix issues with that framework in this package.
